      "in this video I'm going to tell you the best laptops for students now for this one my team and I went absolutely nuts we got in pretty much every viable student laptop think I'm joking I am not we tested an epic 15 laptops everything from Apple's MacBook Air to Microsoft Surface laptop from Asus zenbooks to Samsung Galaxy books you name it we tested it oh and if you're wondering what our experience with student laptops is between the three of us who worked on this video we have a combined five University degrees now I value your time so I'm going to very first briefly hit on some important points that you must be aware of when picking a laptop for school then I'm going to get straight into what you're actually here to see which is which laptops we recommend for various types of students firstly the laptop should be small and portable unless we get hit by another virus which we all hope we don't students frequently move from classroom to classroom plus they often have group projects where they meet in various locations no no one wants to Lug around a heavy Beast of a machine also when you have a laptop open in class you don't want to be the person who blocks the view to the teacher and the board for those sitting behind you because your laptop is large on the flip side you'll want a laptop that's large enough to get real work done that means you want to see a good amount of content on screen now you may think that a laptop screen size is what determines how much content you can see and it is a key factor but size as you know isn't everything there are two other factors that determine this the first is the clarity of the screen which is determined by how many pixels it has to precisely display content and the second is how bright the screen is therefore students should ideally get a 14 inch laptop with a resolution higher than 1920x1200 and a screen brighter than 400 nits which will also help you see the screen in a bright environment like using it close to a window and schools tend to have lots of Windows if you do need to compromise on one of these factors you will survive with only a 1920x1200 resolution display we have two Dell XPS 13 plus laptops in the studio a high resolution one and one with a substantially lower resolution display we found that you'll see an additional three rows of excel with a sharper screen next as a student you're likely to be at school for several years you'll want the laptop to last that means you want to have enough performance to be future proof for most students all modern processors will be good enough however for those doing degrees that have additional software requirement like math design video editing software development special note if you're looking at Intel laptops I'd avoid getting one with a u-series processor those processors are not fast enough to Future proof your purchase if you get an Intel laptop get one with a more beefy P or H series now if you go for an Apple laptop or one with an AMD processor you won't have to worry about this as their entire lineup is powerful enough I'll speak more about these types of students later in the video now for all students try to get a laptop with 16 gig of RAM some manufacturers Apple still only offers 8 gig in many of their base models which is an absolute disgrace for the price they charge and when it comes to storage 512 gigs should really be the minimum unless you're starting something storage intensive like film in which case you'll probably want one terabyte on the note of longevity you should buy your laptop from a reputable brand especially one that offers the ability to purchase an extended warranty some manufacturers like Dell even have an upgrade where someone will come to meet you next business day to fix your laptop make sure you leave money in your budget to ensure your laptop has a warranty long enough to cover your time at school next you'll likely want decent battery life yes modern classrooms have outlets at every desk but you will face situations where there aren't enough for example you're doing group work in a place with limited Outlets like a coffee store apple is your best bet here their laptops run circles around Windows laptops when it comes to battery life that being said some PC laptops do have decent battery life I'll be placing a link to all the laptops we tested in a sheet which you can access from the link below on that sheet I've clearly marked out battery test results so you can see which laptops are good enough moving along you don't want a laptop that has distracting fan noise no one wants to be that person who's in class and suddenly your laptop's fan spin up and everyone looks at you and you also don't want your laptop to feel uncomfortably warm to the touch that will also be distracting next you may be tempted to buy a Chromebook or a tablet with a keyboard instead of a full-blown laptop yes these will work for several types of students with very basic needs but you really are making things harder on yourself than they need to be more applications will run on the standard laptop if you get one of those devices you'll regularly have to find workarounds for things that just come easily to students with a standard laptop plus if you ever use your laptop on your lap balancing a tablet stand it's really not a pleasant experience and finally make sure to use the discounts available to you reach out to your school to find out what discounts they have and to help you out the sheet I mentioned earlier where I'm listing all the laptops I recommend will have links to the cheapest possible prices that they are currently available for and if you're strapped for cash I highly recommend buying a returned laptop from a reputable seller Best Buy has their open box laptops Apple has their refurbished program and Dell has their outlet store the reason I way prefer you buy from these over eBay or Craigslist is these laptops will come with warranties and return policies so in the event that something doesn't work or you just don't like the laptop you can do something about it plus you may be able to stack discounts on top of these already reduced prices alright before we get into recommendations as mentioned every laptop that we've tested that could be a good student laptop will be listed on the sheet which I'm linking below we will will be keeping that sheet updated well past this video going live and I may put some additional laptops or expanded rationale in there that I don't have time to cover in this video alright after testing tons of different laptops from all major brands the best laptop for most students right now is the Asus Zenbook 14x this laptop has a large 14.5 inch display a stunning high resolution OLED panel 16 gig of RAM and 512 gig of storage but none of those positives are wides our number one choice firstly it only costs a thousand US Dollars and that's before sales that is a lot lower than competitors with similar specs second if you thought this laptop would feel cheaper than bigger name competitors you'd be wrong it feels premium and has one of the best keyboards I've used thirdly unlike competitors that use a lower powered Intel U or P series processors this is a very powerful 8 series processor inside and yet it surprisingly runs quieter and feels cooler to the touch than other laptops with less powerful processors I don't know how they're doing it but it is amazing fourth even with the powerful processor its battery life is solid at over eight hours for our Netflix video playback test our next favorite is the MacBook Air with M2 it has several benefits over the Zenbook in that it is significantly lighter it feels even more premium it has longer battery life and it has substantially better graphics performance so if you plan to do something like video editing it's going to be viable on this laptop but it costs a lot more than the Zenbook for a similarly spec machine and its CPU performance is substantially worse for those students who want to draw on their laptop or use it as a tablet we've got a tie between lenovo's yoga 9i and the HP Specter X360 13.5 both offer similar benefits with the most noticeable difference being that the yoga 9i has a bit of fan noise whereas the Specter X360 doesn't on the flip side the Specter X360 isn't the fastest of machines although it is good enough for using office and browsing the web since these laptops are so close to each other in their overall value proposition I choose which one to get based on which is on the best sale at the time you buy both of these laptops regularly go on substantial sales where their prices drop by several hundred dollars for the students who like to game one laptop really stands out it's the Asus G14 I know this laptop really well I personally bought one last year and used it a ton I then upgraded to this year's model the G14 is incredibly powerful for its size and can be had with a variety of different high-powered Graphics right up to the RTX 4080 although I find the RTX 4060 model is really The Sweet Spot in terms of price to Performance and on pricing it's really reasonable for what you get especially if you buy it on a sale and it regularly goes on sale compared to last year's model this year's version is now dead quiet for casual tasks like browsing the web and working on office documents the main downside with this laptop is it gets extremely warm to the touch when you use it in fact you may want to use an external keyboard when you game if you want a laptop that can steal game and doesn't feel as warm to the touch stay tuned as I'm about to talk about lenovo's new 14-inch slim Pro 9i in a couple of minutes for students looking for a laptop for video or photo editing the MacBook Pro 14 is the one to get it is the only portable high-powered laptop that can tackle these tasks with little to no fan noise or a hot feeling chassis it is really unique here plus it is extremely well built it has very long battery life excellent sound a phenomenal display and the best trackpad if the current model is too expensive for you you can pick up last year's M1 version for a heavy discount which is still very good if you do want a Windows laptop for these tasks or as I said you are looking for something that you can do some gaming on the side on lenovo's new 14-inch slim Pro 9i is absolutely awesome compared to the Asus G14 that I just mentioned the slim pro99 doesn't get as warm to the touch and its fan noise is significantly quieter the slim Pro 9i also has a gorgeous me mini LED 165 Hertz refresh rate display the main downside of that laptop is that it just isn't available to buy right now in the USA although Lenovo has promised me it will be available soon for the students studying software development like I did or other disciplines that require a higher performing machine the best laptop to get is the MacBook Pro 14. it has all the benefits for software developers that I mentioned earlier in the video editing section plus due to its amazing display you'll see a ton of code on screen and that is very helpful for software development FYI on Mac OS I always find I can comfortably see a lot more code on screen than on similarly sized Windows laptops now if you don't want to Mac the Asus M book 14x or the slim Pro 9i are both excellent options for software development they are both plenty powerful and have excellent high resolution displays the main difference between the two is that the Zenbook 14x is much cheaper and has a more comfortable keyboard the pro 9i on the other hand has dedicated graphic 6. finally if you need a budget pick the MacBook Air with M1 from several years ago is now heavily on sale and is still very good on the Windows Side hp's Pavilion plus is my favorite it's a good all-round laptop with no major issues it has all the specs you'll need as a student for a great price just make sure to get the model with a brighter screen its main downside is that it feels cheap and its trackpad is just okay that being said if you can find the Zenbook 14x close to either of these laptops prices definitely get the Zenbook to round out here is why we don't recommend the following popular student laptops and some of these you only really see the issues when you can compare them side by side to better laptops like we did first the Samsung Galaxy book 3 Pro 14 it is light and has a lovely screen however the keyboard is not that comfortable it gets very warm to the touch and has Fair noise plus its battery life is not that great the Dell XPS 13 plus feels high quality and it looks stunning unfortunately its battery life is Dreadful and has no physical function row and it gets very warm to the touch Microsoft's surface laptop 5 put up some terrible performance results and it just looks dated with its large bezels well the novos flex 5 has a low quality display that is dim for a display in 2023 and lacks color accuracy Acer Swift go just feels cheap and didn't really have anything going for it excuse the pun lenovo's ThinkPad yoga just felt dated compared to the own yoga 9i and this is Razer Blade 14 although very nice and I did like it a lot is insanely expensive for students and it gets very warm to the touch while you use it well that's it as I said my sheet which I will link below will be regularly updated with where to go for the best possible prices for these laptops if you find there is a cheaper price available just let me know with a comment below and we'll update it and big thanks to all the manufacturers who sent laptops in for this video as well as my wallet which had to purchase several of them so please please please please do me a solid and share this video share it with students and parents you know share it on Facebook groups LinkedIn and all that kind of stuff finally special call out to b h who sent more laptops in than anyone else if you don't know b h not only is it a great store to purchase camera gear but it has tons of laptops available too their shipping is insanely fast and they have several laptops that I haven't seen for sale anywhere else in the USA so check them out well that's all for today folks if you like this video you know what to do smash that like button and get subscribed not only does it show your appreciation for the insane effort that went into this video but it also makes my mother very proud and make sure to check out my new channel which is all about how to be successful in your career either quickly climbing the corporate ladder or starting a business I'll place a link to that Channel Down Below too till next time go do something awesome with your day and I will catch you later \n"
