This project proposes an innovative mobile application that leverages Generative AI (GenAI) to personalize the learning experience for students. The app tackles the challenge of information overload by allowing users to specify a topic and then curating relevant video lectures with timestamps for specific subtopics. GenAI further personalizes learning by generating clear and concise notes from video lectures and uploaded PDFs. Interactive quizzes tailored to the chosen concept solidify understanding, while performance analysis reports provide valuable insights into strengths and weaknesses. This app empowers students to become active participants in their education by fostering personalized learning, enhanced efficiency, deeper understanding, and self-directed learning.

# Proposed Methodology

Related Videos: This section presents a curated list of videos relevant to the selected topic. Each video is segmented into subtopics with timestamps, making it easier for students to navigate and focus on specific sections. AI-generated blog notes accompany these videos, providing a concise summary of the content for quick reference.

PDF Upload and AI-Generated Notes: Students can upload PDFs containing additional relevant information. The app analyzes these documents and generates detailed notes, highlighting key concepts and making it easier for students to review and retain information.

Related Topics: To broaden the student’s understanding, the app suggests related topics. This helps in building a comprehensive knowledge base around the primary subject.

Chat Bot: Integrated into the app, the chatbot offers real-time support. It answers questions, provides clarifications, and assists with navigating the learning materials, ensuring that students have continuous access to help as needed.

Task Assignment: Based on the content from videos and notes, the app assigns tasks designed to test the student’s comprehension and application of the material. These tasks include a variety of interactive elements to engage the learner.

Quizzes: The app generates AI-driven quizzes that include multiple-choice questions and, where applicable, coding snippets to test programming skills. These quizzes are tailored to assess the student’s understanding of the material comprehensively.

Previous Year Questions: To provide practical preparation, the app includes questions from previous years’ exams, such as GATE and other significant assessments. This helps students familiarize themselves with the format and level of difficulty they can expect in actual exams.

Performance Analysis: After completing the quizzes, the app generates a detailed performance analysis. This report highlights areas of strength and identifies weaknesses, offering insights into specific areas that need further attention.

Options: Based on the performance analysis, students can choose their next steps. They might revisit learning materials, retake quizzes, or proceed to additional tasks, ensuring a tailored and adaptive learning experience.

Interview Preparation: As an optional feature, the app offers simulated interview sessions based on the studied topics. This is particularly useful for students preparing for job interviews or oral exams, providing them with a realistic practice environment to boost their confidence and readiness.
